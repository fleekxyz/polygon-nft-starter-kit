# Polygon PFP Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates how a NFT PFP contract can be structured. This is not a production-ready contract and users are advised to use Access Control features in Solidity and/or [OpenZepplin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) to configure maximum security.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
